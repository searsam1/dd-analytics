# dd-analytics

I drive for doorDash so I thought it would be interesting to see what my analytics look like. It isnt really much yet, but once I get more orders and better at data analysis then it should get better.

## Heatmap for DoorDash
Red means I doordashed that day.

Grey means I didn't.

This one is for my steps. Black means I took very little and as you get brighter you get more steps taken that day.
